# Band-Gap-Prediction-Using-ML

This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project that predicts the band gap of materials using various features of the materials. The project was developed-benefiting codes in IntroMLLab and MAST-ML in NanoHub-as part of a Master's thesis in Physics.

The repository contains the following files:

- main.py: This is the main script for the project. It contains the code for training and evaluating the machine learning model that predicts the band gap of a material from its chemical composition.
- BandGapPredict-Notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that contains the code and analysis for the project.
-requirements.txt: This file specifies the Python packages that are required for the project.
- data/* : A directory that contains the input data
- figures/* : A directory that contains the generated figures

## Requirements

In order to run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3
- pandas==1.1.1
- numpy==1.19.1
- matplotlib==3.3.2
- scikit-learn==0.24.1

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aiostarex/Band-Gap-Prediction-Using-ML.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Band-Gap-Prediction-Using-ML`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the project: `python main.py`


For more details about the project, please refer to the Jupyter notebook and the Master's thesis, which can be found in https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/ under title "*Estimating the band gap of materials with machine learning methods*".
