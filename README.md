# Band-Gap-Prediction-Using-ML

This machine learning program is developed benefiting codes in IntroMLLab and MAST-ML in NanoHub.
To predict not only band gaps but also other physical properties with ease, a generalizable machine learning algorithm with an automated feature selection method was developed. 

Codes are available as a jupyter-notebook for now, and compatible with cloud platforms such as Kaggle and AWS.
