# Band-Gap-Prediction-Using-ML

This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project that predicts the band gap of materials using various features of the materials. The project was developed-benefiting codes in IntroMLLab and MAST-ML in NanoHub-as part of a Master's thesis in Physics.

The repository contains the following files:

BandGapPredict-Notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that contains the code and analysis for the project.
data/: A directory that contains the input data for the project.
figures/: A directory that contains the figures generated for the project.

To run the code, clone the repository and install the required libraries. Then, open the Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions in the notebook.

The project uses the libraries such as numpy, pandas, sklearn and mast-ml for data processing and machine learning. The code is written in the python programming language.

For more details about the project, please refer to the Jupyter notebook and the Master's thesis, which can be found in https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/ under title "Estimating the band gap of materials with machine learning methods".

Please feel free to contact the author for any questions or comments about the project.
